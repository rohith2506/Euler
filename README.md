### Disclaimer:
Inorder to respect the opinion of project euler that solutions cannot be shared, I am adding some random numbers in the middle of solution such that it will give a wrong answer when you run things directly. This is intentionally done as I don't want to take away the fun solving problems.

But for certain problems, I will discuss the approach in my blog but on a higher level view. Will leave the details for readers to figure things out.
